The Firebase SDK may throw an error if the provided authentication credentials are invalid or if there is a network issue preventing communication with the Firebase servers.  Another uncommon error occurs when you're attempting to access data in a Firebase Realtime Database or Firestore that is not properly secured with security rules. Improperly configured rules can result in unexpected permission denied errors.
